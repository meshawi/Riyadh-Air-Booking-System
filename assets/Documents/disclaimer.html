        of the academic requirements for the Applied College at Imam Mohammad

        The project "Riyadh Airlines Booking System" is a simulation and
        conceptual exercise created solely for academic purposes. It is not a
        real airline booking system, and any resemblance to actual airlines or
        booking systems, living or dead, is purely coincidental. The project is
        intended to showcase the skills and knowledge acquired during the course
        of the Graduation Project at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University.

        result of creative imagination and does not represent an actual business
        entity. The use of the company name "Riyadh Air" and its booking system

        should not be interpreted as an endorsement or affiliation with any
        existing entity.
